** Description:  Write a class called Box that has three double fields called height,
*                width and length.  The class should have set methods for each field.
*                It should have a three-parameter constructor that takes three doubles
*                and uses them to initialize the fields of the Box.
*                It should have a default constructor that initializes each field to 1.
*                It should have a method that calculates and returns the volume of the Box
*                and a method that calculates and returns the surface area of the Box.
