** Description:  Write a class called Box that has three double fields called height, 
*                width and length.  The class should have set methods for each field.  
*                It should have a three-parameter constructor that takes three doubles 
*                and uses them to initialize the fields of the Box.  
*                It should have a default constructor that initializes each field to 1.  
*                It should have a method that calculates and returns the volume of the Box 
*                and a method that calculates and returns the surface area of the Box.
